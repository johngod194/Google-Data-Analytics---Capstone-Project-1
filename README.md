# Google-Data-Analytics---Capstone-Cyclistic - Project
As part of the Google Data Analytics course I chose to complete the Cyclistic case study using data from 2024
Case study: How does a bike-share navigate speedy success?

**In this project I will be using SQL for cleaning, transformation and analysis. Then Tableau will be used for visualisation to enhance the analysis.**

## Background
As a junior data analyst on Cyclistic’s marketing team, I was assigned to explore how casual riders and annual members use the company’s bike-share service differently. The goal was to identify actionable insights to inform marketing strategies that encourage casual riders to become annual members. I produced three evidence-based recommendations supported by analysis and visualisations.

**This project aims to reply 3 main questions:**
1.	How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
2.	Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
3.	How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
