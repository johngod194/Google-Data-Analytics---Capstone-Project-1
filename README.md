# Google Data Analytics Capstone - Cyclistic Project
As part of the Google Data Analytics program, this repository includes the Cyclistic case study (2024 edition, How does a bike share navigate speedy success?). 

**The project applies SQL to clean, transform, and analyse historical trip data, then uses R (on Kaggle) to produce the analysis report and supporting visualisations.**

## Background
As a junior data analyst on Cyclistic’s marketing team, I was assigned to explore how casual riders and annual members use the company’s bike-share service differently. The goal was to identify actionable insights to inform marketing strategies that encourage casual riders to become annual members. I produced three evidence-based recommendations supported by analysis and visualisations.

**This project aims to answer 3 main questions:**
1.	How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? 
2.	Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships? 
3.	How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
